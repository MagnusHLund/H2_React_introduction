# assignment

1. Create a hello world component (HelloWorld.tsx)
2. Create a timer that updates every second (Timer.tsx)
3. Create a counter using the useState hook. I will implement this as part of the 2nd assignment, to fast forward time. (Timer.tsx)
4. Use react router to navigate between pages. (main.tsx / App.tsx / Navbar.tsx)
5. Create a form, which shows the inputted data, once submitted. (Form.tsx which calls Alert.tsx)
6. Use styled-components, to style. (Navbar.tsx)
7. Create an alert component, which shows a message given on the page. (Alert.tsx)
8. Show a number as a h1 element, which is its own component. (ShowNumber.tsx)

I will be including each of these assignment, in this single react project rather than splitting it up into smaller projects.
